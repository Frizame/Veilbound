# **Veilbound**

**Veilbound** is a stealth-action game where the player steps into the shoes of a **Spirit Hunter** whose mission is to track down and capture ethereal creatures known as **Phantoms**. The game revolves around using throwable **Spectral Orbs** to capture these mysterious beings while navigating a dynamic and ever-changing environment.

#### **Core Gameplay Loop:**
1. **Explore the Environment**:
   - Players are placed in diverse, mystical environments like enchanted forests, haunted ruins, or frozen wastelands. Each environment features a day/night cycle and weather conditions that affect how Phantoms behave and where they are more likely to be found.
   - Phantoms leave subtle visual cues like shimmering trails, distorted air, or glowing footprints, guiding the player toward their location. Tracking them successfully is key to closing in for the capture.

2. **Track and Observe Phantoms**:
   - Phantoms vary in behavior, speed, and rarity. Some are skittish and flee at the slightest sound, while others may exhibit more aggressive or unpredictable behaviors.
   - Players must balance **stealth** and **speed** while approaching Phantoms. Moving too quickly may startle them, while lingering too long risks the Phantom disappearing into the shadows.
   - Strategic thinking is necessary, as players will need to position themselves for the perfect throw without alerting their target.

3. **Capture with Spectral Orbs**:
   - The main tool for capturing Phantoms is the **Spectral Orb**, a throwable device that locks onto the Phantom’s energy signature upon a successful throw. Players must aim, anticipate the Phantom’s movement, and release the orb at just the right moment.
   - Players can charge the orb for longer throws or to improve accuracy, but charging for too long risks alerting the Phantom, adding tension to the capture process.
   - As players progress, they unlock different types of **elemental orbs**—each with unique effects (such as freezing, stunning, or temporarily immobilizing a Phantom)—offering different tactical options depending on the type of Phantom they’re hunting.

4. **Absorb Spectral Essence**:
   - Upon successfully capturing a Phantom, players absorb its **spectral essence**, which plays a crucial role in progression. Essence can be used in several ways:
     - **Upgrade Tools and Equipment**: Enhance the power, accuracy, and effects of Spectral Orbs and other tools.
     - **Skill Mastery Tree**: Unlock and upgrade abilities in the **Spirit Mastery Tree**, such as enhancing the player’s ability to track Phantoms, improving stealth, or allowing for quicker orb cooldowns.
     - **Craft New Gear**: Players can spend essence to craft or upgrade traps, tracking devices, and environmental tools to make future hunts easier.
     - **Gain Temporary Powers**: Spectral essence can grant the player temporary boosts like **speed**, **invisibility**, or the ability to manipulate the environment, making subsequent captures more manageable or allowing for creative approaches to tricky Phantoms.

5. **Strategic Play and Environmental Adaptation**:
   - Environments are designed to change dynamically, with shifting weather patterns, day and night cycles, and natural hazards (like fog, heavy rain, or magical storms) that affect both the player and the Phantoms. Some Phantoms may only appear during specific times, forcing players to adapt to the changing landscape.
   - Players must use all their tools and wits to locate and capture rare or elusive Phantoms. This could involve setting traps, using lures, or waiting for specific environmental conditions to appear.

6. **Score and Progression**:
   - Each Phantom captured is worth points, with rarer and more difficult Phantoms offering greater rewards. Players are incentivized to capture as many Phantoms as possible in a single session to build high scores and earn bonuses for efficient or skillful play.
   - As players absorb more spectral essence and upgrade their abilities, they will be able to tackle increasingly rare and powerful Phantoms, which may require a combination of upgraded equipment and precise strategy to capture.
   - The player’s progress is tied to capturing these increasingly difficult Phantoms, gaining more essence, and unlocking new tools to refine their hunting abilities.

#### **Phantom Types**:
- **Common Phantoms**: Easier to locate and capture, typically found in open areas. They serve as the bread and butter of the game, useful for farming essence early on.
- **Rare Phantoms**: These creatures are more elusive, often appearing in harder-to-reach locations or during specific environmental conditions. They may have unique behaviors like teleporting, moving in bursts of speed, or turning invisible for brief moments.
- **Mythic Phantoms**: These are the most powerful and difficult Phantoms to capture. They may require specific tools or conditions to even appear, and successfully capturing one rewards the player with a large amount of essence and rare crafting materials.

#### **Tool and Equipment Customization**:
- Players can customize and upgrade their gear using the **spectral essence** they collect. Upgrades include faster orb throws, improved trap effectiveness, and enhancements that let players detect Phantoms from farther away.
- Different loadouts can be created for different Phantom types, offering flexibility in how players approach each hunt.
